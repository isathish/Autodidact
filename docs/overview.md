# Overview

Autodidact is an AI research framework designed for autonomous learning agents. It integrates multiple AI components such as perception, memory, language, motor control, and reinforcement learning to create self-improving systems.

## Key Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Each component is isolated in its own module for maintainability.
- **Multi-Modal Perception**: Supports visual, DOM-based, and other sensory inputs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements advanced RL algorithms like PPO.
- **Meta-Learning**: Optimizes learning strategies over time.
- **Deployment Ready**: Includes Kubernetes and Docker configurations.

## Goals
The primary goal of Autodidact is to enable agents to learn autonomously in complex environments, improving their performance without explicit human intervention.
